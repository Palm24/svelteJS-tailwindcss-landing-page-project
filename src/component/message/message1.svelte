    is rising fast and, thus far, natural gas has played a major role in meeting this rising demand. Although the country is abundantly rich in natural gas resources the investment of Exploration and Production will not be able to unlock these
                resources in time to fulfil this fast-growing need for power. The foreseeable production decline from offshore legacy assets will likely result in tighter supply in the future. The LNG solution, if not well thought out through the entire
                gas to power value chain, will most likely be constrained by existing infrastructure (e.g. pipeline over capacity). To serve mid- and long-terms demand of Myanmar, Delta Gas Transportation Limited (DGT) believes in the value creation of
                domestic resources hence this Domestic Gas to Power is initiated together with substantial petroleum operations in PSC blocks.
